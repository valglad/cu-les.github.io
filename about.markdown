We're a student-run group who bring theatre (normally daft theatre) to those who don't normally get the chance to see it, like special needs schools and retirement homes. We also do public shows to raise money for various charities.

We generally perform a play and a pantomime in both Michaelmas and Lent. In Easter we perform four short plays around a theme (designed to be manageable and relaxing for after exams!). All of these are written, directed and produced by members of the society, often first-timers.

We also just like hanging out with each other. We go see shows put on by our sister society in Oxford, [OULES](http://oules.lightentertainment.org/), and they come to see us. We usually have a camping trip to somewhere with forests or mountains in the summer, and a three-day-long New Year's party together. Some of us head up to the Edinburgh Fringe in August to do a more professional show (also normally daft), with things like actual theatres, budgets, sometimes even rehearsals.
